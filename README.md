[Tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-discord-bot-with-javascript-nodejs/)
### Install the code on your local machine
1. Create a folder and navigate to it using the Windows Terminal.
2. run `npm init -y` to setup basic structure
3. run `npm install dotenv` to install dotenv, a library to keep the token safe
4. run `npm install discord.js` to install Discord.js, the library to create the bot itself
5. create a .js file (i recommend `index.js`) and put the code in it
6. run `node <filename>.js` to start the bot and wait until you get a message like `Logged in as Uselessstory-Bot#1049`
